### Testing `S2DC` app

You can test this application locally, you just need to follow the following instructions that will help you play around with our tool in development mode.

1. clone this repository by running:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CrispenGari/S2DC.git
```

2. navigate to the server by running the following command:

```shell
cd  server
```

3. create a virtual environment on the server folder, activate it and install required packages by running the following command:

```shell
virtualenv venv && .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Start the server by running the following command:

```shell
python server.py
```

5. When the server is running it will start on a default port of `3001` go ahead and open `ngrok` cli and run the following command:

```shell
ngrok http 3001
```

6. Copy the forwarding url from the `ngrok` shell that looks as follows:

```shell
Forwarding                    https://4c1a-102-66-137-117.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:3001
```

7. Navigate to the `client/src/constants/index.ts` file and change the constant `serverBaseURL` to the forwarding url for example as follows:

```ts
export const serverBaseURL: string =
  "https://4c1a-102-66-137-117.ngrok-free.app";
```

8. Now you can start the expo app but first navigate to the `client` on another terminal and run the following command:

```shell
cd client && yarn && expo install && yarn start
```

9. Scan the `QR` code using your phone and start using the `tool`. Make sure that you have `expo-go` installed in your `android` or `ios` phone before scanning the `QR` code.

### Dataset

The dataset that was used to train the `AI` tool was found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niyarrbarman/symptom2disease)

### Notebooks

The `.ipynb` notebook that was used to train and save the model can be found:
